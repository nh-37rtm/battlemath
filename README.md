This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### fork notes 

#### polling and WSL
as pointed by the folowing issue ``https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4739`` polling do not work with WSL2 (in a mounted filesystem from windows only ?), as told by Soviut :
> A workaround for anyone using Webpack or other tool that uses Chokidar under the hood; you can set an environment variable to use polling instead of listening for file events.
> 
> ```
> CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=1
> ```
> 
> I use this with Docker by putting it in a `.env` file that Docker Compose picks up when it starts. However, you should be able to prepend any start commands with this env as well.
> 
> ```
> CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=1 npm start
> ```
> 
> This isn't a great solution since it dramatically increases the resources the OS or Docker needs to consume in order to perform the polling and it will drain your laptop batteries way faster than actual file system event watching, but it works until WSL2 triggers those file system events.
